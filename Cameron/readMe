Here's the updates version of realRun with coins.
Check it out.
I have two sets if coins we can use.
Go to lin 108 in real run and change "coin/coin" to "coins/starCoin" and you can see the other coin I added.
Tell me which one you want in the game for the regular coins.
The special can be the starCoin (021 - 030) which I still have to add.
